    <div><strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> enables central switching and setting of WLAN-capable devices via mobile end devices such as smartphones/tablets or also on PCs.
      <br>
      Switching times and dimming of lighting fixtures can be freely defined. Timings can be based on sunrise/sunset and can vary with random time periods. Such settings are also combined into daily and weekly schedules.
      <br>
      With such designed schedules activity in the house is simulated even in the absence.
      <br>
      The <strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> functions are grouped on several WEB pages and provide settings, operation, schedule tracking or calling the documentation with an easy to use menu control.
      <br>

      <strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> is aimed at users who want to use smartphones or PCs as a control center for switching and setting the home installation, and at the same time want to be able to change the settings easily - for example, the
      daily schedule.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div><strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> runs as an application on a RaspberryPI (RPI).

    <h3 id="overview"><em><strong>schedule+</strong></em> -- Start page / Devices in the WLAN</h3>
    <div>Fig.1 shows the start page of the app with the devices available in the WLAN with their names and their respective states. Switching devices are shown with a green=ON or red=OFF switch, dimmers with a slider. These elements are also used for
      ON/OFF switching and for changing the dimming brightness, respectively.

    <div>Die <strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> app has a header on all pages, this is also a menu button to open the 'Main Menu'.
      The opened menu provides access to the <strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> functions, so it always goes back to the home page [overview] from here.
    </div>

    <h3 id="timeSwitching"><em><strong>Day Schedule -- Work with time schedule</strong></em></h3>
    <div><strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> provides a simple menu-driven concept for the definition of daily schedules consisting of a set of switching operations (named jobs).</div>

    <h4 id="jobDefinition">Job Definition</h4>
    <div>With <strong><em>schedule+</em></strong> the user defines at which time a device should be switched -- this is called a job.
      <br>

      The time definition of a 'job' is done with absolute time, relative to a previously defined time (e.g. to switch off a device after a certain time) or also relative to <code>Sunrise / Sunset</code>. All time specifications are variable with
      random times.
      <br>
      Multiple actions for the same device can be defined as one job.
    </div>

    <h4 id="dayPlanDefinition">Day Schedule</h4>
    <div>A Day Schedule consists of a series of combined jobs. A Day Schedule definition refers to one daily schedule at a time and is saved under any name as a text file (with the extension '.ini') -- e.g. <span class="mono">'schedulePlus.ini
        â–¼'</span>.</div>

    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="schedule+ Tagesplan Beispiel" style="width:70%" src="pict/dayplan.png"></div>

    <div style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Fig.3 - Day Schedule Example</strong></div>

    <div>The 'Current Day Schedule' shows in the rows of a table the jobs, i.e. the switching times of the devices with their scheduled functions (ON/OFF/SET/NEW).

      <div style="margin-left: 12px;"><em>Note -- When calling up the 'Current Day Schedule', only the jobs that are pending on this day are displayed.
        </em></div>
      <div>
        With the <img src="icon/entry-delete.svg" class="imgdoc"> icon on the right side of the line, the job can be deleted for execution.

        <div style="margin-left: 12px;"><em>Note -- The deletion is done only for the 'Current Day Schedule', the day plan (.ini) file will not be changed!</em>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div>
      The header of the daily schedule table is used for further function calls:
    </div>

    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="schedule+ Tagesplan Kopfzeile" style="width:70%" src="pict/schedulefileactions.png"></div>

    <ul>
      <p style="margin-left: -20px;"><em> In the center, the display of the current daily schedule:</em></p>
      <li>an example: <span class="mono">'aussen.ini â–¼',</span> it also serves as a selection menu for loading other daily schedules</li>
      <p style="margin-left: -20px;"><em> Links to update the daily schedule:</em></p>
      <li><img src="icon/refresh.svg" class="imgdoc"> The daily schedule is updated with the pending jobs of the day
      </li>
      <p style="margin-left: -20px;"><em> Right to edit the daily schedule:</em></p>
      <li><img src="icon/edit.svg" class="imgdoc"> Icon to start modifing the displayed daily schedule</li>
      <li><img src="icon/plus.svg" class="imgdoc"> Adding a job only to the active daily schedule, but not to the (.ini) file. Thus, this job is valid only for the current day; general changes to the day plan is done only with the <img
          src="icon/edit.svg" class="imgdoc">Editor.</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      Above the daily schedule table are the current sunrise and sunset times, which are calculated on a daily basis using the local GeoLocation. Using the <img src="icon/marker-blue.svg" class="imgdoc"><span class="mono"> GeoLocation </span>
      icon calls up a map on which the current GeoDetails can be checked and set if necessary.

    <h4 id="weekplan">Week Plan</h4>
    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="Wochenplan" src="pict/weekPlan.png" style="width:70%"></div>
    <div>The weekly schedule defines different daily schedules for each day of the week. If no daily schedule is defined for a weekday (or if it is not available), the schedule of the previous day will continue to be used. For example, different
      schedules can be defined for the days for the days Monday to Friday and for the weekend.</div>

    <h4 id="logfiles">Log Dateien</h4>

    <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="Day Logs" src="pict/logfiles.png" style="width:70%"></div>
    <div>The Log file page loads a list of the jobs already executed on the current day [ â–¸ Today].
      The activities of the other days of the week can also be retrieved. These lists are written continuously every day in a weekly rhythm.
    </div>

    <div><em>All completed job executions and further details can be called up via the "Overview" page (see above).
